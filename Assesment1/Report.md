## Summary

In this report I will discuss the GUI best practices defined by the Design Tips _(UI Design Do’s and Don’ts, n.d.)_, an official Apple website guide directed towards the GUI practices intended to be followed while developing an Apple mobile application. The GUI best practices I will be covering will include; Formatting Content, Touch Controls, Hit Targets, Text Size, Contrast, Spacing, High Resolution, Distortion, Organization, and Alignment. These are the 10 design tips forwarded in this article that I will be referencing 

### Formatting Content
When formatting content the Do's and Don'ts guide says to "Create a layout that fits the screen of an iOS device. Users should see primary content without zooming or scrolling horizontally.". This means that the content should not expand past the width of the phone, this can be acheived by moving the content vertically down the application allowing vertical scrolling to fit the content on the screen.

### Touch Controls
When you have Touch Controls on the page the Do's and Don'ts guide says "Use UI elements that are designed for touch gestured to make interaction with your app feel easy and natural.". An example of this is to use a calander control instead of building a calander control via individual controls, the native control should be used because the funcitonality is compact and more efficient than building one itself.

### Hit Targets
Hit Targets for example are buttons or interactive controls, the Do's and Don'ts guide tells us to "Create controls that measure at least 44 points x 44 points so they can be accurately tapped with a finger.". This sizing guide line directs us to create controls with an appropriate size so buttons can be clicked easily with a finger which is important when interacting with an application on a mobile device.
