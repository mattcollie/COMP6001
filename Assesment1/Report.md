## Summary
In this report I will discuss the GUI best practices defined by the Design Tips _(UI Design Do’s and Don’ts, n.d.)_, an official Apple website guide directed towards the GUI practices intended to be followed while developing an Apple mobile application. The GUI best practices I will be covering will include; Formatting Content, Touch Controls, Hit Targets, Text Size, Contrast, Spacing, High Resolution, Distortion, Organization, and Alignment. These are the 10 design tips forwarded in this article that I will be referencing 

### Formatting Content
When formatting content the Do's and Don'ts guide says to "Create a layout that fits the screen of an iOS device. Users should see primary content without zooming or scrolling horizontally.". This means that the content should not expand past the width of the phone, this can be acheived by moving the content vertically down the application allowing vertical scrolling to fit the content on the screen.

### Touch Controls
When you have Touch Controls on the page the Do's and Don'ts guide says "Use UI elements that are designed for touch gestured to make interaction with your app feel easy and natural.". An example of this is to use a calander control instead of building a calander control via individual controls, the native control should be used because the funcitonality is compact and more efficient than building one itself.

### Hit Targets
Hit Targets for example are buttons or interactive controls, the Do's and Don'ts guide tells us to "Create controls that measure at least 44 points x 44 points so they can be accurately tapped with a finger.". This sizing guide line directs us to create controls with an appropriate size so buttons can be clicked easily with a finger which is important when interacting with an application on a mobile device.

### Text Size
Text size is important for an application because if the text is too small it becomes impractical to read, the Do's and Don'ts guide says "Text should be at least 11 points so it's legible at a typical viewing distance withut zooming.". This means all text must be in at least 11 points.

### Contrast
Contrast is important within an application on the mobile, if the contrast is too dim in a light environment the content will be hard to read, the Do's and Don'ts guide says "Make sure there is ample contrast between the font color and the background so text is legible.". Keeping text colour relevant to the background colour in contrast is important so text is legible.

### Spacing
Spacing between lettering, text and content is important to easily display information that is readable, the Do's and Don'ts guide says "Don't let text overlap. Improve legibility by increasing line height or letter spacing.". This means to give adequate spacing between text to improve readability.

### High Resolution
Resolution of images should be as high as possible so the quality can be displayed on the application, the Do's and Don'ts guide says "Provide high-resolution versions of all image assets. Images that are not @2x and @3x will appear blurry on the Retina display." This means resolutions should follow the standard @2x and @3x so they don't appear blurry.

### Distortion
It is important to keep the aspect ratio to avoid distortion of images when displaying them on the appliation or else they will appear out of place, the Do's and Don'ts guide says "Always display images at their intended aspect ratio to avoid distortion.".

### Organization
The organization of controls is important within an applicaiton, you want to keep controls evenly spaced and easy to use, the Do's and Don'ts guide tells us "Create and easy-to-read layout that puts controls close to the content they modify.". You want to organize controls in an intuitive manner to make it easy-to-read.

### Alignment
Aligning controls and content in an easy-to-read layout, like organization this will influence how the user reads down the page. The Do's and Don'ts guide tells us "Align text, images, and buttons to show users how information is related.". You want to keep all related information together.
